### Hi there 👋

![logo](logo/michu-tech-logo-black-white.svg)
Checkout [michu-tech.com](https://michu-tech.com) for a list of my deployed projects. 

I am a young and motivated developer ✨, passionate about the latest tech trends and constantly seeking out the newest advancements in the industry 📈. I'm invested in problem-solving and always eager to learn and grow 🧠. My creativity shines through in the code I write, as I love crafting elegant solutions that make a real impact 💻.

Currently I am deeply invested in my mTui framework. The framework aims to drasticly simplify the "UI" work for terminal applications.
You can inform mTui about your command & query structure and their implementation and it will handle the entire user communication for you. This way you never have to worry about input parsing and UI components. Also since the actuall frontend is just a terminal, mTui can provide "Frontends" for many platforms. mTui provides generic "Frontends" for Web, Desktop and Mobile.
